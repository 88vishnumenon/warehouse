# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `start the node api  in port 7000 to get the data from the services `

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `guidelines`
- All components are functional components with react hooks.
- Redux is used for managing the state of the application.
- jest and react testing library are used to write the unit test cases for few of the components.  
- Snapshot testing is added in few components t
- comments are added to improve readability of code.


### `improvements`


- All the service end points could not be used.But with more time all diffrent end points could be integrated as diffrent menu and user operations.


- Unit test cases have been implemented for few of the components to showcase how this will be approached.The coverage of unit test caees can be improved.
